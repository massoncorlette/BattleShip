This projects instructions provides pretty minimal directions on how to go about 
making this. I have more freedom on this than any previous project, here is 
some things I want to make sure of:

- Make sure to use decoupled pure functions for Test Driven Development, this would
also result in following SOLID principles

- Pay attention to how I represent the gameboard, since I want the ships to be able 
to change direction. 



11/10 Psuedo (game.js)

***We can use an adjacency list for computer
attacks (attacking surrounding coordinates from 
potential moves from given vertice)***

intializingApp() will use DOM function to render

function to start game calling shipPlacement()

shipPlacement() to place all ships (use maybe random/ or manual coordinates for now)
		- Use a decoupled Pure function so we can 
			test ships are being placed right



- Try to follow the conventional Git command standards
